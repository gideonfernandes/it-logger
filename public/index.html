      content="The idea of ​​this project is to create a communication application
      for an IT department, in which we can add some problems with urgent
      tag or not, filter them by title or technical author, delete them,
      add more technical authors, etc. It was developed with the aim of studying
      the React library with Redux during the React Front To Back course,
      taught by Brad Traversy."
